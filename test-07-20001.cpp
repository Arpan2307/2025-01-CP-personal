/*
Name: Permutations
Reference: https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1070

A permutation of integers 1,2,\ldots,n is called beautiful if 
there are no adjacent elements whose difference is 1.

Input: There are t test cases. In each test case, you are given an intger n.
If there are several solutions, you may print any of them.

Output: For each case, print the a beautiful permutation if such a permutation exists.
Otherwise print -1.
